Description
-----------

Ragout (Reference-Assisted Genome Ordering UTility) is a tool for
assisted assembly using multiple references. It takes a short read
assembly (a set of contigs), a set of related references
and a corresponding phylogenetic tree and then assembles the contigs into
scaffolds.

The benefits of assembly with multiple references become significant,
when those references have structural variations compared to the target
genome. Even if each reference is structurally divergent, it is possible
to assemble the target into the correct set of scaffolds. Enlarge your
contigs with Ragout!

The current version of Ragout is limited to genomes of bacterial size,
but we are working on expanding it to mammalinan-scaled ones.
